In January this year (2022) I went through interview processes with 2 companies. I had realized that doing interviews with 3 or more companies at the same time was way too exhausting and time-consuming, and decided to block any other interview requests for the time I interview with those two companies.

The interview process for the two companies was very light and projected-oriented (as opposed to algorithm coding sessions or conversational), and I loved it.

The final interview with Cribl ran from 4pm to 5:30pm on Friday, so I was ready to be relaxed over the weekend and wait for the result the following week. So I was definitely surprised when I got contacted by the hiring manager after 1 hour, asking if I would be available for a follow-up call.

And I got an offer, with its details on that call. I don't think I've ever been more excited than that day, ever since I got a job at Uncharted Software, at least as far as career side of life goes. There are many reasons I'm excited about this journey, but mostly it comes down to two reasons.

The product, the problem space, and the industry, all of which are directly linked to the work I would be doing, were something I've been hoping to work on for a while. Cribl is a heavy data engineering product, and is positioned in the "deep tech", so to speak. It's quite different from what 70-80% of software engineers work on, and I loved it. It can involve a lot of integrations work, and that's also something I'm looking forward to. For the past few years I've been enjoying development a little less, but I'm hoping that my passion will be sparked again at Cribl.

The second reason I was so excited was the compensation part. During the call with the recruiter, I had stated my desired salary to be about 105-130% of my current salary. The response from her was that my expectation is somewhat high, but I proceeded anyway because of the aforementioned first reason. When my hiring manager discussed the offer details, I thought I heard him wrong. It was much higher than 130% of my current salary. That, plus quarterly bonus and stock options. My mind was blown. What he said got stuck in my head: "...we want to make sure you have less things to worry about in life so that we can focus on creating software". When that word is accompanied by a really good compensation, I'm assured they really mean it. No negotiations nor any games necessary. Honestly, I would be happy with this pay for at least 3 years without an increase.

As much as I'm thrilled about this new journey, I'm also a little nervous. I'm somewhat new to the field, and I'm sure all the folks at Cribl are really smart. The product seemed to be top quality from what the public sandbox I briefly tried. I would feel guilty not to deliver with the compensation I receive. But the other side of me thinks I can handle it well, as I always have in the past workplaces. Regardless, I can't wait for March 7th.
