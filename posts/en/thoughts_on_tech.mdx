It is not exactly every day that I bring up a rather controversial topic, but I can't shake off the feeling that this will haunt me for years if I don't let it out.
And just one day before I'm heading back to Canada from visting South Korea seemed like an unironically appropriate time to write this.

Here in South Korea, it's safe to say advanced technologies are pretty damn widespread. Everyone uses their smartphones to make payments, virtually every restaurant has kiosks to take orders, and the fully automated robot coffee shop I've seen for the first time in my life, was a week ago, here in Korea.

The last time I visited Korea was 5 years ago. Within just 5 years, the degree that things have changed here was enormous.

Was I impressed? You bet.

Was I excited? Not quite.

Technological advancements are largely driven by desires to be more efficient. Do things faster, and with less effort.

Thanks to the kiosks, restaurant staffs can reduce the time serving each customer and hence, serve more customers.

But.

Can they serve every type of customers? Think of older people. We can't blame them for not willing to learn new techs because by the time they've learned the shiny new tech, a newer tech would've emerged.

Think of restaurant staffs this time. They can serve more customers, but do they make more money? Also they need to do fewer types of work, but their work also gets more repetitive.

People feel more efficient and convenient when they enable everything on their smartphones - with the tiny card-shaped device, they can do everything. But also at the same time, all those things depend on the smartphone.

What all these examples gravitate towards is polarization. And the more polarized society is, the more gaps there are between different classes of society.

And polarization in turn, implies centralization of power.

Just about a thousand years ago, whatever humans do, there was nothing that can threaten the existence of their own species.

Now? There are a few buttons that can wipe out humans and make our mother planet uninhabitable.

Centralization of power is dangerous.

You might ask, am I experiencing existential crisis as a software engineer?

Well, it's more of the opposite, actually. I believe there are ways that tech can solve these problems.

The deeper problem is tech follows where money goes, and that's the part that calls for remedy.
