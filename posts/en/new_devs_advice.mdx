You might have felt, at some point in your life, or at least heard about the work experience dilemma. You’re just out of school. You start looking for jobs and search the online job platforms for the positions that look like a good fit for you. Turns out, all those “Entry” or “Junior” positions require 1~2 years of work experience. How can you possibly get work experience if all of the job positions out there require prior work experience?!

Let me be upfront with this. I had 2 years and 8 months of co-op experiences before starting a full time job. To be fair, though, the first 2 years of those times were not very relevant to software development. So it’s fair to say these are advice I would give to myself before that relevant last 8 months co-op term. Also, I struggled for 4 months to find the first full time position, having interviews with at least 30 companies during that period, even after the 8 months co-op. These are some of the things I wish I knew back then.


# 1. What school you went to and grades are not as important as you might think

Well, unless you’re applying for grad school.

Most employers don’t give a monkey’s about grades. Unless you got a really high mark, like 4.0/4.0 or close, I’d say don’t even bother including it in your resume. This is because it has continuously been proven by statistics that there is almost no correlation between school performance and work performance. If you’re still in school, take courses that interest you more rather than the ones you think will give you a good grade.

And schools - okay, true, some companies do care about what schools you went to. But there are much more great companies that care least about it, so it shouldn’t be a showstopper if you didn’t go to one of those prestigious universities.

# 2. Even if you don’t have work experience, you still need some sort of things to show to the employers

If you are looking for a software developer position, this is hands down the most important advice I can give you.

Think from employers’ perspectives. You received applications from 100 people, they’re all recent graduates, and have no internship or co-op experiences. How the hell would you select the ones for interviews, let alone hire? School? Grade? Hope you didn't forget my first point already. As an employer, the only measure I really have is whether and what kind of projects they worked on by themselves.

Fortunately, it’s easy to work on a non-professional project in the field of software development, compared to other fields.

If you have something in your mind what to create, great - go for it. Just make sure it’s not another to-do app.

If not, I always think it’s a great exercise to create a clone of something (Instagram, Facebook, etc) to boost your development skills. A big advantage here is that since you can play around with the real app, you don’t have to worry about design, UX, requirements, etc and focus solely on implementations. A common misconception is that you always need to create something useful or things that people will actually use. If you have such an idea, then again, great - go for it. But if your main goal is to learn, not market success or making money, you really don’t have to. Employers fully understand this and don’t really care about whether it’s a clone or your original.

Once you decide what to create, then choose the technologies you want to use and look up some tutorials to get started on the internet. Luckily nowadays there are millions of such tutorials. One really important thing here is, never google the walkthrough of the entire solution (e.g. “How to create a Facebook clone in React and Python”). You will not learn much by merely following a tutorial. Instead, use tutorials to simply get started (e.g. create a minimal to-do app in React and Python) and then modify and expand it to create what you want.

# 3. Stop thinking you’re special

Sorry for the harsh words, but I can never stress this enough. Of course you’re special - special to yourself, your family and friends, but are you really special to employers?

If you’re a reasonably realistic person, you probably know that you’ll be seen equally as other candidates. But still, there’s a good chance that you’re subconsciously thinking that you’re special, because it’s inevitable to be self-centric to some degree. You’ve never been someone else, after all. You might have been told constantly by your parents that you’re special, so it’s very common that this is deeply rooted in your subconsciousness.

This was the case for me as well.

Me after an interview, then: “Nothing went bad on that one, so I should hear back from them.”

Me after an interview, nowadays: “Nothing stood out as exceptional on that one, so I might not hear back from them.”

It’s not like I became a pessimistic person. But I learned some realities, after doing so many interviews.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not telling you to abandon the idea you’re special. My point is, put some effort to appear as special, even to employers. Maybe do A LOT of research on the company so you have your own insights to ask smart questions on the business and product. Maybe work on a small project that resembles the product of the company you’re applying for and appeal that during the interview.

Do something that will make you stand out among others.
